At **Optime Labs LLC** ("we," "our," or "us"), your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your information when you use our mobile application, **SnapCue** (the ‚ÄúApp‚Äù).

By using SnapCue, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.


## 1. Information We Collect

### a. Personal Information  
We do **not collect** any personal information. There is no login or account creation in the app.

### b. Content You Provide  
When you upload or capture an image using the app (e.g., a coupon, RSVP, or any date-based content), the image is stored **locally on your device**.  
The app automatically extracts date information (e.g., event dates, valid from, or expiration dates) for reminder purposes. No image data or metadata is transmitted or stored online.


## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information available within the app solely to:

- Let you upload and manage image-based entries like coupons and RSVPs.
- Extract relevant date information to generate reminders.
- Notify you of upcoming events, deadlines, or expirations.
- Ensure compliance with applicable laws and maintain app functionality.

We do **not** collect or store this information on external servers or share it with any third parties.


## 3. How We Share Your Information

We do **not** share your information. All images and reminder data remain stored locally on your device. No personal or user-provided data is sent to our servers or to third parties.


## 4. Data Security

We implement reasonable and industry-standard security measures to protect any data stored locally by the app on your device. However, the security of your device is your responsibility.  
In the unlikely event of a security issue, we will inform affected users in accordance with applicable data protection laws.


## 5. Your Choices

Since your data is stored locally and not on our servers, you have full control over:

- **Accessing** your stored images and reminders.
- **Deleting** any or all data via your device or through the app‚Äôs features.
- **Modifying** or managing reminders directly within the app.


## 6. Children‚Äôs Privacy

SnapCue is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has used the app inappropriately, please contact us at **apps@optime-labs.com**.


## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. All changes will be reflected by updating the ‚ÄúLast Updated‚Äù date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.


## 8. Your Privacy Rights (by Jurisdiction)
